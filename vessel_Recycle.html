		<h3>Trinitas – Most cost efficient solution provider for demolition of vessels</h3>
		<p>Trinitas Ship Management Pvt. Ltd., (TSM) though in its infancy is owned and managed by a very experienced team of Master Mariners and Chief Engineers 
		having a wealth of management experience of over 50 years combined. 
		TSM, is well supported and associated with Zebec Marine Consultants & Services, Mumbai who have joined hands 
		and together we cover all facets of ship management and consultancy in the Marine industry.
		</p>
		<p>
		Trinitas Ship Management (TSM), excels in providing a complete one stop solution to vessels heading on their final voyages for demolition from any location across the world. 
		This is a niche which our team has been associated with  for the past 5 years and have managed over 200 vessels since November 2011. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The team is led Captain Shashi D’Souza (Director TSM) and Chief Engineer A.L.R. Viegas (Consulting - Technical Advisor) with our head office in Mumbai.
		They and the entire team has been working together for several years.  We also ensure that the top four Officers who man our vessels are those who have worked with us in the past.
		The excellent bonding of the team who have worked together from 2011, ensures that we are in a position to provide very cost effective management of vessels as well as assures our 
		Owners that their valuable assets are well protected and safely managed which in turn means that our Owners remain competitive in the global markets they serve
		</p>
		<p>
		Our team ensures complete management of the vessel and in addition assists our Cash Buyers to make an informed decision of the purchase by initiating a high quality pre-purchase inspection.
		This enables our Cash Buyers to have a very clear idea of the type of vessel and equipment on board as well as other factors like non-ferrous material, quantity of spares, more accurate bunker balance figures, etc.
		Issues like local port conditions and possible legal issues can also be checked.  Consequent to the pre-purchase inspection we make a very accurate estimate of the costs involved to bring the vsl from her present location to the recycling yards in the Indian Subcontinent.
		The large number of vessels handled and constant tweaking has enabled us to make these costings as accurate as possible giving due allowance to the vagaries of the sea and the weather.
		The pre-purchase could be done for both laid up or vessel sold on ‘as is’. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Our USP is based on our reputation for a smooth, cost effective, efficient and most importantly transparent communication with all parties including vendors, 
		and our promise that all costs and billing will be on actuals. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Our management activities would include all matters pertaining to the final voyage to the breaking yards, including day to day monitoring and corrective management of the vessel, and arranging various supplies and statutory requirements.  Though limited to and basis our Buyers requirements, 
		the following  are our activities:
